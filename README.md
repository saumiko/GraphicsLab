# Computer Graphics Algortihm Implementations

This repository contains the implementations of some basic computer graphics algorithms in OpenGL and GLUT framework. These assignments were given by [Professor M. Jahirul Islam, PhD., PEng.](http://www.sust.edu/d/cse/faculty-profile-detail/1) as a part of the CSE 374 Course.

## How to build and run
Read [this file](https://github.com/saumiko/GraphicsLab/blob/master/GetStartedWithOpenGL&GLUTonOSX.pdf) to get started with the build process. Just open your desired algorithm and run according to the instructions given here.
